## Candy Crush

A puzzle game that involves making matches of 3 or more colored candy pieces. Players swap candy pieces either horizontally and vertically, and once a match is made, the candy disappears, causing the surrounding pieces of candy to fall into the empty spaces.

To win, score as much points under the alloted moves.
